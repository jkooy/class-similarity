# Class-similarity
This repo offers the code to calculate similarity of different dataset based on dataset labels using cosine similarity and GloVe embedding.

  *cosine_similarity.py* provides the function to calculate the cosine similarity between two GloVe vector.

  *embedding.py* converts labels of dataset to GloVe vectors.

  *get_avelabel.py* gets labels from label json files.

  *label_similarity.py* is the main function to calculate the similarity given the label files.
